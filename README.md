# Medical Insurance Price Prediction

![Project Demo](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1m3Mj4DXNAgCuYWRSgxzcbPF0o9rheMaC)

## üìñ Introduction

This project is a web application that predicts medical insurance costs for individuals based on their personal attributes. It features an interactive, user-friendly interface where users can input their information‚Äîsuch as age, sex, BMI, and smoking habits‚Äîto receive an instant price estimate. The project combines a robust machine learning model with a responsive web front-end to provide a seamless user experience.

## üéØ Project Goals

*   **Predictive Accuracy:** To build and deploy a reliable machine learning model that accurately predicts medical insurance charges.
*   **User Experience:** To create an intuitive and responsive web interface that makes it easy for users to get predictions.
*   **Educational Tool:** To serve as a demonstration of a full-stack machine learning application, from data analysis and model training to deployment.
*   **Transparency:** To provide users with information about the dataset and the factors that influence insurance costs.

## üíª Technologies Used

## üìä Dataset

The model is trained on the **"Medical Cost Personal Datasets"** from Kaggle. This dataset contains 1,338 observations with the following attributes:

*   **`age`**: Age of the primary beneficiary.
*   **`sex`**: Gender of the beneficiary (female, male).
*   **`bmi`**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat.
*   **`children`**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
*   **`smoker`**: Whether the person is a smoker (yes, no).
*   **`region`**: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
*   **`charges`** (Target): Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

The complete data analysis and visualization can be found in the `Visualisations (EDA).ipynb` notebook.

## ü§ñ Model

The prediction model is an XGBoost Regressor. 
- The target variable (`charges`) was log-transformed (`log(x+1)`) to handle its skewness, a common practice for price prediction. 
- The categorical features (`sex`, `smoker`, `region`) were converted into a numerical format for the model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Model Training Workflow

The entire process of building the predictive model is detailed in the project's Jupyter Notebooks and follows these steps:

## ‚ú® Why It Matters

Understanding potential healthcare costs is crucial for financial planning. This tool provides a quick and accessible way for individuals to get a data-driven estimate of their medical insurance expenses. For developers and data scientists, this project serves as a practical, end-to-end example of how to build and deploy a machine learning model as a web service.
